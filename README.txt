This is a solo project from my Survey of Artificial Intelligence Course. It was done in Spring 2024. I uploaded it to Git to use as an example on my resume.

For this project, I generated fake road data, which includes things like speed limits and traffic lights. Then I used A* to find the shortest distance and the quickest path between any 2 points.
